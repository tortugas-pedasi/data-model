# Turtle observations data model

Documentation for the modeling of data captured when observing turtles and turtle nests.

## Why?

In Panam√°, there are a number of organisations involved in the tracking and monitoring of wild turtles. Currently, there is no standard as to what data is captured, and data is not easily shareable between organisations.

By working together to create a unified data model, organisations can collaborate and share data more effectively, deepening insights into the lives of turtles, and improving the effectiveness of conservation and education of these beautiful creatures.

This project serves as a living document and proposal for a common standard by which organisations can capture data about turtles.
