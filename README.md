# Turtle observations data model

Documentation for the modeling of data captured when observing turtles and turtle nests.

## Why?

In Panam√°, there are a number of organisations involved in the tracking and monitoring of wild turtles. Currently, there is no standard as to what data is captured, and data is not easily shareable between organisations.

By working together to create a unified data model, organisations can collaborate and share data more effectively, deepening insights into the lives of turtles, and improving the effectiveness of conservation and education of these beautiful creatures.

This project serves as a living document and proposal for a common standard by which organisations can capture data about turtles.

## Contributing

This is an open source project - we welcome and encourage discussion and feedback so that we can improve our understanding of what data is important to capture, how to capture it, and how the data matters to different people and organisations. 

Please see our [code of conduct](./CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to get involved.
